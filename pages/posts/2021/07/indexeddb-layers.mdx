I've recently wrote a small [flashcard app](https://leitcard.jokens.me) inspired
by the [leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) for personal use.

The stack was designed with Dexie as the database (persistence) layer, Redux (toolkit) as state management, and Chakra-ui on top.

Writing full-stack usually means a better understanding of the entire infrastructure. As for me, a simple functional PWA was enough.
